# Dungeon-Generator
A random dungeon generator made for an example


The basic version only has the three special characters.
Not anything fancy just made to see how easy it would be to implement and adjust.

Try to only use a max of 20x20 otherwise it may take a while to generate.

The other branch has another special character and attempts to use process pools to speed up the process
